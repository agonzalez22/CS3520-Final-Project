# CS3520 Final Project - Community Center Reservation System
Alina Gonzalez & Khushi Khan 

## Reservation System 
This reservation system will permit organizers to book events and specify dates and guest capacity, as well as publish events for other users to view. Users can then purchase tickets for any event that has not reached capacity, or an event that they are permitted to attend.
